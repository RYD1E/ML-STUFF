# ODI 2023 Cricket Teams Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project is being undertaken as a mentorship initiative at The Syntax Society, where I am guiding students through the process. The objective is to cluster ODI 2023 cricket teams based on their performance in past matches before the upcoming event.

## Goal
The main goal of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience in data analysis, feature engineering, and clustering techniques. By working on real-world data from ODI matches, they will gain valuable insights into the world of sports analytics.

## Project Scope
The project will cover the following key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gathering historical match data for ODI teams participating in the 2023 event.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features to represent the strengths of each team.
4. Clustering: Applying clustering algorithms to group teams based on their performance features.
5. Data Visualization: Creating informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to enhance the understanding of the analysis results.
6. Evaluation: Assessing the quality of clusters and interpreting the results.
